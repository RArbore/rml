#+TITLE: rml
rml is a simple C library for machine learning. rml is currently under development - below is a list of planned features
- Tensors (initialization, destruction, basic operations)
  - DONE Initialization, management, building block operations
  - TO DETERMINE More complex operations on tensors
- TODO Nice file I/O with CSVs & a .rml format (denser tensor serialization)
- TODO POSIX threading
- TODO Python & Golang bindings
- TODO Basic deep learning layers (inference)
- TODO Graph generation of operations conducted in series
- TODO Backprop gradients over generated graph
- TODO Gradient descent optimization
- TODO More complex layers (convolutional, recurrent, etc.)
rml is free / libre software licensed under the LGPL v3.0.
