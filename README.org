#+TITLE: rml
rml is a simple C library for machine learning. rml is currently under development - below is a list of planned features:
- Tensors (initialization, destruction, basic operations)
  - *DONE* Initialization, management, building block operations
  - *PERPETUAL IN-PROGRESS* More complex operations on tensors
- Nice file I/O
  - *DONE* CSVs
  - *TODO* an .rml format (denser tensor serialization)
  - *TODO* serialize models
- Computational graph generation of conducted operations
  - *DONE* Dynamic graph generation
  - *DONE* Graph management
- OpenCL support
  - *DONE* Minimal working CL example
  - *DONE* Framework for constructing tensor operations using OpenCL kernels
  - *IN-PROGRESS* CL implementations of basic operations (~50% done)
- *TODO* Backprop gradients over generated graph
- *TODO* Gradient descent optimization
- *TODO* Python & Golang bindings
- *TODO* Basic deep learning layers (inference)
- *TODO* More complex layers (convolutional, recurrent, etc.)
rml is free / libre software licensed under the LGPL v3.0.
rml can be easily installed on most Linux distributions.
1. Clone the repository,

   =$ git clone https://github.com/RArbore/rml.git=

2. Navigate into the workspace,

   =$ cd rml=

3. Install (requires root privileges to place =librml.so= inside =/usr/lib= and =rml.h= inside =/usr/include=),

   =# make install=

To use rml in your C program...
1. Include =rml.h=, =#include <rml.h>=
2. Compile with rml,

   =$ gcc ... -lrml ...=

Currently, rml is just a library for C. Once rml's core functionality is finished, bindings will be created for other languages.
