#+TITLE: rml
rml is a simple C library for machine learning. rml is currently under development - below is a list of planned features
- Tensors (initialization, destruction, basic operations)
  - *DONE* Initialization, management, building block operations
  - *IN-PROGRESS* More complex operations on tensors
- Nice file I/O
  - *DONE* CSVs
  - *TODO* an .rml format (denser tensor serialization)
  - *TODO* serialize models
- *TODO* POSIX threading
- *TODO* Python & Golang bindings
- *TODO* Basic deep learning layers (inference)
- *TODO* Graph generation of operations conducted in series
- *TODO* Backprop gradients over generated graph
- *TODO* Gradient descent optimization
- *TODO* More complex layers (convolutional, recurrent, etc.)
rml is free / libre software licensed under the LGPL v3.0.
